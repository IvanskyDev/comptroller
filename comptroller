While we received positive feedback regarding the updating of cDAI interest rate model, the community also clearly indicated a reticence to decouple from MCD at this time. As a result, we are proposing an updated cDAI interest rate model, but this model does not decouple from MCD. We intend to continue to iterate on the model over the coming months.\n\n\n## Updated Model\n- [Deployed contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdf44fd0dc991c41ba87812441f98902df2df5786#code)\n- [Pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/31)\n\n\n## Interest Rate Model Updates\nWe are proposing the following changes to the cDAI interest rate model:\n\n**1. Change APY at 100% util**\n- Current: 15%\n- New: 25%\n\n\n**2. Change the Utilization Rate that defines the \"kink\"**\n- Current: 90%\n- New: 80%\n\n\n**3. Change `gapPerBlock`, the parameter that determines the \"slope\" prior to the kink**\n- Current: 2%\n- New: 4% *(**note:** with current SF / DSR,  this gives an APY of 4.34% at the kink)*\n\n\n**4. No change to Base Rate per Block (APR at 0% utilization)**\n- Current: 0%\n- New: 0%\n\n\n## Rationale for the Changes\n**Change 1: Increase APY at 100% Utilization**\n\nWhen a Compound asset is 100% utilized, suppliers are unable to withdraw their capital, and new borrowers cannot take on loans. This is extremely suboptimal, and should be reflected by handsome compensation to suppliers. In our view, 15% APY is not sufficiently high to achieve rapid asset re-allocation in a 100% utilization scenario, nor does it accurately reflect the lockup that suppliers experience. As such, we propose raising this parameter to 25% APY.\n\n\n**Change 2: Change the Utilization Rate that Defines the \"Kink\"**\n\nThe \"kink\" in the cDAI interest rate model reflects the utilization rate at which the slope of the interest rate goes from \"gradual\" to \"steep\". That is, below this utilization rate, the slope of the interest rate curve is gradual. Above this utilization rate, it is steep.\n\n\nBecause of this dynamic between the interest rate curves before and after the \"kink\", the \"kink\" can be thought of as the target utilization rate. Above that rate, it quickly becomes expensive to borrow (and commensurately lucrative for suppliers).\n\n\nIn our view, 90% Utilization should not be the target utilization. This would mean that the protocol aims to only allow 10% of capital suppliers to exit the system at any given time. In our opinion, this is insufficient. We suggest that a greater portion of the capital suppliers should be able to exit at any time, and as such propose lowering the utilization rate that defines the \"kink\" to 80%.\n\n\n**Change 3: Change APY at \"Kink\"**\n\nAs we said in Change 3, the \"kink\" defines the target utilization of the market. Thus, the interest rate at the kink is the target interest rate. And in our view, 2% APY is too low to be the current \"target interest rate\". We approach the question of \"what is the right target interest rate?\" with humility. We honestly don't know. As such, we decided to approach searching for the ideal rate by doubling it, and then adjusting based on further market indications. We hope to see market indications that suggest that the curve is \"in range\". Should these indications materialize, changes to the parameter can become more incremental.\n\n\n**No Change to Base Rate per Block**\n\nIn our view, it is appropriate to set the interest rate at 0% when there is no utilization of the asset. At zero utilization, the market is indicating that borrowing that asset is not attractive. Increasing the interest rate would only exacerbate the unattractiveness of borrowing the asset. As such, we left this parameter unchanged.","for_votes":"133613.887401438391091383","id":12,"states":[{"end_time":1593627293,"start_time":1593627293,"state":"pending","trx_hash":"0xec6cddd238e8ec8b12c44dc2dadcdd315da21586713e34339c1eed4ed2342d90"},{"end_time":1593858030,"start_time":1593627293,"state":"active","trx_hash":null},{"end_time":null,"start_time":1593858030,"state":"defeated","trx_hash":null}],"title":"Update cDAI Interest Rate Model"},{"against_votes":"1.336940941763063553","description":"This proposal implements a new Comptroller contract, patching the [refreshCompSpeeds](https://compound.finance/docs/comptroller#refresh-comp-speeds) function.\n\nIt modifies the allocation of COMP across markets, by removing the borrowing interest rate as a weighting mechanism.

We support blck's proposal because we agree that the Reserve Factor needs to increase. But we do not think Proposal 8 goes far enough. We propose raising the Reserve Factor to 20% (from either 0% if blck's proposal fails, or 10% if it succeeds).\n\n**Background on Reserve Factor**\n\nThe Reserve Factor in Compound is the parameter that controls how much of the interest for a given asset is routed to that asset's Reserve Pool. The Reserve Pool protects lenders against borrower default and liquidation malfunction. For example, a 5% Reserve Factor means that 5% of the interest that borrowers pay for that asset would be routed to the Reserve Pool instead of to lenders.\n\n\nThus, as a market grows, it is important that the Reserve Pool grow commensurately in order to adequately protect lenders.\n\n**Why 10% is too low for USDT's Reserve Factor**\n\nWe believe there are two reasons for raising the Reserve Factor to 20% (vs. 10%).\n\n\nAs has been discussed at length in the Compound Discord's [#governance channel](https://discord.com/channels/402910780124561410/682253201701208169), the USDT market is being manipulated by COMP token harvesters, taking advantage of the interest rate model of USDT to generate COMP for themselves. A 20% Reserve Factor will remove 20% of the incentive, reducing the \"earned interest\" for lenders and thus their incentive to game the system.\n\n\nIn the long-run, it's likely that 20% is too high to be sustainable. But we believe that it will rapidly address the incentive gaming currently taking place, and if 20% does end up being too draconian, we will address that by reducing the Reserve Factor in the future.","for_votes":"758651.150222134072424704","id":9,"states":[{"end_time":1592503801,"start_time":1592503801,"state":"pending","trx_hash":"0x8a313dc707673803b392888f3da05c3701202d8ced3aaf580f33187dac1f44ca"},{"end_time":1592734401,"start_time":1592503801,"state":"active","trx_hash":null},{"end_time":null,"start_time":1592734401,"state":"succeeded","trx_hash":null},{"end_time":1592941070,"start_time":1592768270,"state":"queued","trx_hash":"0x2852c1e79ce588c30c38d8c32f5c2ce5d40796b816b7adf6efe29da693be6dc6"},{"end_time":null,"start_time":1593097312,"state":"executed","trx_hash":"0x70a20058a942e8ee21b18549156288251108ed530bf5ea61c3b52e77be271fc7"}],"title":"Set reserve factor for cUSDT to 20.0%"},{"against_votes":"15001.610928463986564715","description":"Currently, USDT is the only market on Compound with 0% reserve; previously, we discussed that this should be changed, the market rapid growth requires changes to provide safe lending to the users.","for_votes":"1413016.673345396736409959","id":8,"states":[{"end_time":1592437864,"start_time":1592437864,"state":"pending","trx_hash":"0xa7e942c420c357a4ff4046364e233450df52b6f86f6650d850c4616d9b05bf50"},{"end_time":1592668417,"start_time":1592437864,"state":"active","trx_hash":null},{"end_time":null,"start_time":1592668417,"state":"succeeded","trx_hash":null},{"end_time":1592841442,"start_time":1592668642,"state":"queued","trx_hash":"0x8f5f68cf4762c7584b7bd9dd7cb546af3dafc878c74a000f143bf12825036365"},{"end_time":null,"start_time":1592842312,"state":"executed","trx_hash":"0x7ce0617eb9476200d145a46a0fec88435a86fba136bfa82723505164a454c4c7"}],"title":"Increase USDT Reserve Factor from 0% to 10%"}],"request":{"network":"mainnet","page_number":1,"page_size":10,"proposal_ids":[],"state":"","with_detail":false}}
